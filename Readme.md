What is Email Validation?
Email validation is a process that verifies if an email address is
valid or not. This procedure will catch if there are any typos or other mistakes
which might result in misdirects and bounces. Email validation will also confirm
whether the email exists with a valid domain or not such as Google or Yahoo.
Some of the reasons for verifying your email addresses is to eliminate hard bounces,
reduce spam complaints and avoid getting blacklisted.
